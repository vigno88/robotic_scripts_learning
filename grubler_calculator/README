This script takes a file (`.config`) where each line is a joint in the configuration.

Ideally the first line is the type of mechanism `.planar` (2D), `.spatial` (3D).

Then, each line is a joint with 2 links: `<link_name> - <joint> - <link_name>`

List of supported joint:
  - `R` (revolute, 1 dof)
  - `P` (prismatic, 1 dof)
  - `H` (helical, 1 dof)
  - `C` (cylindrical, 2 dof)
  - `U` (universal, 2 dof)
  - `S` (spherical, 3 dof)

The example: `python gruber_calc.py test.config`

Note. Comment can be made using `#`
